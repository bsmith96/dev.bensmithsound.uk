Witness Potter's loving animals spring to life as gorgeously handcrafted puppets lifted straight from the pages of her self-illustrated books. In addition to the bouncy protagonist, theatre fans can look forward to Peter Rabbit's many friends, including Jemima Puddle Duck and the 'prickly' washerwoman Mrs. Tiggly-Winkle, as well as Peter Rabbit's enemy, the vicious Mr. McGregor, who pulls no punches in protecting his succulent lettuce garden from those 'pesky' hungry bunnies."

Her stories have been passed down by each generation for over a century and are now compiled into a spectacular West End musical!"

From his childhood to his early career, from his greatest fashion shows to the wild nights in Le Palace or London, Jean Paul Gaultier shares his journal of the times and pays tribute to those who have inspired him in film (Pedro Almodovar, Luc Besson), music (Madonna, Kylie Minogue, Mylène Farmer) and dance (Régine Chopinot, Angelin Prejlocaj)."

To carry through with this project, he collaborated with the best in their field, such as actress, scriptwriter and director Tonie Marshall, who co-directs the show, and Marion Motin (Madonna, Christine and the Queens, Stromae, RESISTE, the musical...) for choreography. From disco to funk, from pop to rock and also new wave and punk, the Fashion Freak Show is an explosive playlist of hits that have inspired the artist throughout his life. A great festive moment to enjoy irresponsibly! In Saint Petersburg from 31 January to 2 February 2020, then in Moscow from 6 to 24 February."
