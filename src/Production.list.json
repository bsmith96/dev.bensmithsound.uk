Witness Potter's loving animals spring to life as gorgeously handcrafted puppets lifted straight from the pages of her self-illustrated books. In addition to the bouncy protagonist, theatre fans can look forward to Peter Rabbit's many friends, including Jemima Puddle Duck and the 'prickly' washerwoman Mrs. Tiggly-Winkle, as well as Peter Rabbit's enemy, the vicious Mr. McGregor, who pulls no punches in protecting his succulent lettuce garden from those 'pesky' hungry bunnies."

Potter had numerous pets throughout her life and was a lover of both animals and nature, from which her numerous popular children's books were born. Her stories have been passed down by each generation for over a century and are now compiled into a spectacular West End musical!"
