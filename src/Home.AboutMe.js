          <p>I am a freelance theatre sound engineer based in SE London, working as a <strong>sound operator</strong> for musicals and plays: I have worked on Regional productions, National and International Tours, and in the West End. I am confident <strong>mixing musicals</strong>, including working with actor-musicians, click-tracks, and in large venues, as well as looking after backstage as a <strong>Sound No. 2</strong>.</p>
          <p>I also have experience in <strong>sound design</strong> for theatrical productions, concerts and live events.</p>
          {/*<p>I always strive to be adaptable, to take challenges in my stride and work with the entire production team to create the best possible result.</p>*/}

          <p>While live theatre remains a struggle for many creatives and venues, I am also available for work on <strong>recordings</strong> and broadcast events, whether itâ€™s <strong>editing</strong> and cleaning up recordings from zoom, <strong>mixing</strong> a performance remotely or as a livestream, or a creative <strong>sound design</strong> for a digital production.</p>
