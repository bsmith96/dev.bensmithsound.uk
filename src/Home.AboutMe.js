          <p>I am a freelance theatre sound engineer based in London, working as a <strong>sound operator</strong> for both musicals and plays, including Touring and Regional productions, and in the West End.</p>
          <p>I also have experience in <strong>sound design</strong> for theatrical productions and concerts.</p>
          <p>I am available for work on <strong>recordings</strong> and broadcast events, especially while live theatre is not an option for many venues and creatives. Whether itâ€™s <strong>editing</strong> and cleaning up recordings from zoom, <strong>mixing</strong> a performance remotely or as a livestream, or a creative <strong>sound design</strong> for a digital production, I would love to help present your content to a wider audience.</p>
