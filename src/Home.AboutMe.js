          <p>While live theatre remains a struggle for many creatives and venues, I am also available for work on <strong>recordings</strong> and broadcast events. Whether itâ€™s <strong>editing</strong> and cleaning up recordings from zoom, <strong>mixing</strong> a performance remotely or as a livestream, or a creative <strong>sound design</strong> for a digital production.</p>
