# Ben Smith Sound - website

This project is the source code for [www.bensmithsound.uk](https://www.bensmithsound.uk). 

This project was started using HTML and CSS with *Bootstrap v5.0.0beta2* CSS and scripts, along with *Sass* to alter the CSS.

There was a temporary incarnation using *pure javascript* and *jQuery* to adjust the rendering of shadows dynamically, and to generate new HTML blocks for new productions.

Now, the site has been adapted to also work with *React*, allowing the list of productions to be automatically generated based on information provided. It will even compare the date of the machine to the date of productions, so I can input show information in advance, and they will appear at the correct time.

Total dependencies:
- Bootstrap v5
- Sass
- React
- react-iframe (for video embedding)
- gh-pages (for deployment)
- Node.js

## Important terminal commands

To preview the site while editing, run `npm start`

To deploy the site to github-pages (please update the version number in *package.json* first), run `npm run deploy`

If you edit *custom.scss* and want to push the changes to the CSS file used for the site, run `sass ./src/_scss/custom.scss ./src/App.css`

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
